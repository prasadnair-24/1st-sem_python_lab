# Exercise 1: Basic Data Types and Operations
# Task: Write a Python program that:

# Takes two numbers as input from the user.
# Performs and prints the results of basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

# Input from user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Operations
print("Addition:", num1 + num2)
print("Subtraction:", num1 - num2)
print("Multiplication:", num1 * num2)
print("Division:", num1 / num2)
